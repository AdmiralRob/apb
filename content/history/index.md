Alaska Print Brokers is an Anchorage-based company specializing in finding the best printers in North
America and Asia to meet the needs of West Coast publishers, authors, photographers and fine artists.
The company evolved out of Alaska Color Scan, which brought the first scanner to Alaska in 1982. This
Crosfield 510 drum scanner provided the latest scanner technology to a market that had never had locally
available color separations before. That company provided color separations to every newspaper and printing
company in Alaska capable of printing color in the 1980s. Ever since that time the company has stayed on the
cutting edge of pre-press technology for the printing industry.

Among Alaska Print Brokers’ customers are some of Alaska’s finest and most successful photographers,
cartoonists and fine artists. These include photographers Patrick Endres of Fairbanks, Todd Salat of Anchorage,
Daniel Evans of Sitka; Chip Porter of Ketchikan and Mark Kelley of Juneau for whom the company has printed two
calendars a year for the last 20 years. It has also produced eight different books in up to 15 printings for Kelley.

One of the company’s most successful customers has been Chad Carpenter, cartoonist of the TUNDRA
cartoon strip, for whom the company has printed more than 250,000 books over a period of 16 years. These and
dozens of other fine art customers are discriminating buyers who are “color-sensitive” and demanding of the
highest quality reproduction for their art.

Other customers are more than 100 publishers including Quail Ridge Press of Brandon, MS; Epicenter Press of
Seattle, WA; Publications Consultants of Anchorage and other out of state publishers who appreciate the high
quality, rapid delivery and low prices the company offers. Alaska Print Brokers has handled all printing done by
the state’s largest publisher and wholesale book, calendar and map distributor, Todd Communications, for 29
years. Printers used by the company are in Anchorage, the Lower 48, Canada and the Orient.

Printing an average of about two books or other items per week, the company has a full time Graphic
Designer on staff. It maintains a full array of both Mac and PC software including Quark, InDesign and PitStop to
prepare books and other printed materials to go to printers for final proofing before presses role. The company
also has two in-house Hewlett-Packard color proofing systems: an Officejet 7000 wide format 4-color system and
a Designjet T770 6-color printer with hard drive.

In addition to both hard and softbound books, the company has produced and delivered calendars, maps,
posters, playing cards, post cards, note cards and more than two million rack cards. We have provided print
services to customers as far away as Mississippi, New Mexico and Washington’s Olympic Peninsula.

It also has several thousand square feet of storage space in Tacoma, WA, as well as Ketchikan, Juneau,
Anchorage and Fairbanks to hold product for customers.

Alaska Print Brokers, due to its in-depth knowledge of pre-press, printing and various printers’ capabilities, is
able to balance the three factors involved in printing to bring the best results to each customer: quality, time and
price.

The company is able to produce both short runs of 100 or less for the print-on-demand market, as well as
10,000 press run and up books for wide distribution. Among these are titles like Susan Butcher’s Granite, Shannon
Cartwright’s board book Alaska 1 2 3 Colors and Numbers, Todd Communications’ Alaska: A Photo Memory and
Alaska Airline’s 80th Anniversary Book.

Among the reasons the company is able to deliver books to Alaska at such competitive prices is the volume
delivered monthly to the state’s major ports from Anchorage to Ketchikan and Sitka to Juneau. It frequently ships
full containers to the state at rates lower than individuals only shipping a few pallets would receive. The same
holds true for its deliveries to Seattle from Korea and China.

As a result of long term relationships with printers in the Lower 48, Korea and China, Alaska Print Brokers is
often able to speed production and negotiate better prices than someone printing on a one time basis. Because
we are a repeat customer that delivers pre-flighted digital files to printers, the company’s business is valued as
relatively trouble free by printers who value the company’s account.

While the printing of black and white books is mostly done by domestic printers, color is done mostly by
offshore printers. Along with printing, the company is able to obtain unusual and very high quality bindery work
from one of Asia’s largest and finest binderies. Among the services offered are book dummies that exactly match
the finished book in every aspect but the ink. These are very helpful to clients who want to make certain their
books will be exactly what they anticipated in terms of paper, binding and appearance.

Color proofs printed on plotters calibrated to the Fogra 39 standard and the press that will actually print the
job give customers’ maximum color control short of doing their own press checks at the time of printing. Press
checks can also be arranged for customers who want them. Alaska Print Brokers’ staff visit most major print
suppliers periodically to conduct press checks, talk with plant management and see new technology being
introduced for use by customers.

Although high quality, good customer communications and speed are Alaska Print Brokers’ hallmarks, the
company is proud of its ability to obtain the best prices available on the world market for book, calendar, map and
playing card printing.
