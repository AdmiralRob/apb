It today's world there are lots of ways to publish a book. Some require good connections or an established reputation (traditional publishing), others require quite a bit of technical know-how (self-publishing). But we aim to make it easy for you no matter what position your in.

Alaska Print Brokers, a subsidiary of Todd Communications is an Anchorage-based company specializing in the needs of publishers, authors, photographers and fine artists in Alaska who want their projects printed and delivered without the headaches that usually occur when they try to handle it by themselves.

## Traditional Publishing

A traditional publishing company would seek to find established or especially skilled authors that have already written successful works, and pay them for their material. The publishing company would then do all the rest of the work on their own dime, and here's the important part, would then take the majority of the profits for themselves as well. They pass on royalty fees to the author.

## Self-Publishing

Self-publishing is different. Essentially if you self-publish you pay up front for your work, and so when the profits start rolling in, they come to you! But that also means you do ALL of the work. You write it, edit it, format it for publication, source (or create) all the artwork, purchase and setup the registration numbers (ISBN, UPC, etc), source a good printer, pay for the upfront printing, house the books, market the books, sell and then distribute the books to retailers. If that sounds like a lot, trust us, it is.

## Our Model

Here's where we come in. We're experienced and knowledgeable in the publishing industry. And we can take on your project and make it a reality, doing everything from the editing down to the distributing of the books for you. All you have to do is write it. But at the same time, you're the publisher, so if your project takes off, you're the one making the profit!

## Our Talent

We have full-time Graphic Designers and Editors on staff that can handle any request you may have regarding your project. And we're here to help with as much or as little of your project as you need.

In addition to both hard and softbound books, we've produced and delivered calendars, maps, playing cards and more than two million rack cards to our customers in the U.S. and abroad.
