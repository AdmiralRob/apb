  <h1>Services</h1>
  <h2 id="design-consulting-project-management-and-editing-services">Design, Consulting, Project Management and Editing Services</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to write a book. It&rsquo;s another thing to put one together. We have fulltime editors and designers on staff that are ready to help you get the polish on your book that really makes it shine. For example, do you have cover art for your book? We can source from some fantastic artists (both locally and around the world!) to really make your book stand out.</p>
<p>As for editing, our editors are some of the most experienced in Alaska. We can just check for typos and grammar, or we can help you adjust the voice of your work to perfectly fit the audience you&rsquo;re targeting.</p>
<p>As we charge by the hour, we can put as little or as much of those services as you need into your masterpiece. Just need us to make sure there are no typos? We&rsquo;ve got you covered. Need to source artwork and get the book designed? We&rsquo;re the ones for the job. Whatever and however much of it you need, we can fill the gap from manuscript to finished product.</p>
<h2 id="copyright-registration-and-publication-codes">Copyright Registration and Publication Codes</h2>
<p>Before you can actually send your book to print, you&rsquo;re going to need it registered. There are quite a few places to go and numbers to register (not to mention formatting barcodes and the like) that are needed to get everything squared off. We&rsquo;re happy to assist in each aspect of the technicalities so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it.</p>
<h2 id="print-brokering">Print Brokering</h2>
<p>The most expensive part of any publication is going to be the physical printing of the book. That&rsquo;s where &ldquo;print brokering&rdquo; comes in. We reach out to all manner of printers, whether they are here in Alaska, in the US, or even worldwide. We can find the highest quality work for the lowest price to make sure your masterpiece doesn&rsquo;t just come out beautiful, but doesn&rsquo;t cost you an arm and a leg to do it.</p>
<h2 id="the-costs">The Costs</h2>
<p>Perhaps you came here to this looking to budget what it will take to get your book published. That, of course, can vary dramatically depending on the project. So here are some sample projects and their costs that will help you get an idea:</p>
